\title{pegboard: Explore and Manipulate Markdown Curricula from the Carpentries}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

The Carpentries (\url{https://carpentries.org}) curricula is made of of lessons that are hosted as websites. Each lesson represents between a half day to two days of instruction and contains several episodes, which are written as 'kramdown'-flavored 'markdown' documents and converted to HTML using the 'Jekyll' static website generator. This package builds on top of the 'tinkr' package; reads in these markdown documents to 'XML' and stores them in R6 classes for convenient exploration and manipulation of sections within episodes.
